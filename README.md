## About

This is a terminal 3d cube map editor.

In its core it's essentially a 3d ascii art editor inside the terminal,
that also outputs blender file format for the cubes map.

Each view in the terminal controls movement in the respective axis.

For example, in the top view, the left/right arrows control the x axis,
and the up/down arrows control the z axis, in the right view left/right
controls z axis and up/down controls y axis, and so on...

When pressing a printable key that isn't hjkl or q (closes the program),
that key is stored in the position of the 3d cursor.
